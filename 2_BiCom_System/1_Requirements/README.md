# RFID Based Attendance System

## Description

* Remote keyless entry (RKE) has taken automobile industry, as evidenced by the RKE's popularity, it now seen in new cars and as a after-market item. This project provides an overview of RKE programs and discusses how they meet the requirements. It shows other regions and design methods and provides specific predictions for future plans, which will include one-way and two-way communication.

## Future Scope

* Remote keyless entry (RKE) programs have become very popular. The rate of installation of RKE programs on new vehicles is more than 80% in North America and more than 70% in Europe. In addition to the obvious benefits of ease of use, RKE-actuated car-immobilization technology reduces car theft. European car manufacturers are integrating automotive technology in partnership with insurance companies, which also require it as a condition for obtaining car insurance. The practice originated in Germany, and it is expected to spread throughout Europe within a few years.
* Most of these systems use a single means of communication (simplex). *But second- and third-generation systems(Bi-Com Systems) may talk to the keys, telling you that the car needs more gas or the alarm status,car battery information, pressure on the left front tire, window status, door status*.
